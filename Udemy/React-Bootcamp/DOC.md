# React

- Makes it easy to make reusable 'view components'
- These 'encapsulate' logic and HTML into a class
- Often make it easier to build modular applications

### Components

- The building blocks of React
- Pieces of UI of view logic
- Classes that know how to render themselves into HTML

#### Class Component

- The 'traditional' React Components
- Wrtie logic in JS Class
- Must include a render Method

#### Function Component

- Historically used for simpler 'dumb' components
- Write logic in a JS Function
- No render Method needed , just return content

### Difference from Class component

- Both can accept props and render content
- Historically, function components couldln't use important features like:

            - State
            - Lifecycle Methods

- With the introductio of Hooks, we can wrtie full-featured function components
- This course covers hooks!

# Our Approach

- We will being working with mainly `Class Components`
- That way we only have to worry about ont syntax at first
- Later in the course we Learn Hooks and mainly wrtie `function components`
